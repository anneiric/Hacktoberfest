How can a beginner participate?
For beginners, they are saying that you could make contributions to documentation for some projects. But this also needs some level of effort. When I heard about Hacktoberfest, I just registered and left it there without doing any contributions. But as I went through the list projects I found some too easy projects to contribute to. So I'm listing here four Github repositories anyone can contribute to, it’s very easy; you just need to add your Github profile name etc in their readme file. Some of them have instructions on how to contribute. So let’s do it!
Step 1: Register or login to github.com
Step 2: Register to Hacktoberfest.
Step 3: Contribute to these five repositories or any others repositories you like, check instructions to contribute in each repositories.
